<p class="text-center">Pacman is a happy, yellow character who wants to get out of the playing area - called a room. In order to do this our cheeky chappie needs to "eat" all of the little yellow dots - correct name, pacdots, whilst avoiding the monsters, which are now called Ghosts. They all have their own names - Inky, Pinky, Blinky and Clyde are the names they begin with - but more about that later! There is a skill level which must be achieved to progress further and if Pacman touches a Ghost then one of Pacman's lives will be lost.<br></br>
In each corner of the room there is a "Power Pellet", which when Pacman eats one, the Ghosts turn blue. Pacman can get extra points by eating the Ghosts. The first one is worth 50 points and each additional Ghost eaten is worth double the number of points.<br></br>
When the PACMAN gets eaten, you'll be presented with a question. Answer it to add more points to your score. Your game score weighs 10% and the answers weigh 90% of your final score.<br></br></p>
